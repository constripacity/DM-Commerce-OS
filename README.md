DM Commerce OS capabilities
Front‑end sandbox for messaging commerce – simulates customer chats, Stripe/PayPal payment events, a product catalog, cart flows, and simple metrics so you can refine copy and UX without real APIs

Configurable connections and simulation controls – toggle WhatsApp, Stripe, and PayPal, enable Auto‑Reply, and start or stop live message/payment simulations with one click

Three themed UI layouts – cycle through “sunset,” “sky,” and “dark” themes via an animated emoji button for peaceful, accessible presentations

Quick‑action panel for agent workflows – prebuilt actions let you send delivery info, generate carts and payment links, or mark orders as paid inside any active thread

Order management with CSV export – orders track provider, status, amount, and items, and can be exported to a spreadsheet‑friendly CSV for merchant hand‑offs

Event log for debugging – every simulated message and payment event is captured in a scrollable log for auditing and demos

These capabilities give the sandbox a realistic feel for conversational commerce flows while remaining entirely front‑end and API‑free.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
